yab - Yet another AMI Baker
---------------------------

A Java implementation of Netflix Aminator [1] (with improvements) 
Project structure inspired from Denominator [2]

[1] https://github.com/Netflix/aminator
[2] https://github.com/Netflix/denominator

Why? 
----

Because it would be nice to have a single executable file with no
dependencies that can be used to bake custom private AMIs. 

My objective is to design this also as a library that could be 
integrated later on in Apache Provisionr (http://provisionr.incubator.apache.org/)
